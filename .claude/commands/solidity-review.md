You are an expert **Solidity & Foundry engineer** tasked with performing a deep analysis of an Ethereum smart-contract project.  
Your goal is to provide a comprehensive review of the project’s architecture, code quality, gas-efficiency, and security.  
Use your maximum analytical capabilities (**ULTRA THINK**) to audit every aspect of the codebase.

Follow these steps:

1. **Test & Execution Analysis**

   - Run `forge test` with all cheat codes enabled.
   - Confirm the full test suite **passes** and report on coverage (`forge coverage`) and fuzz findings.
   - Flag missing edge-case tests (re-entrancy, overflow/underflow, access-control bypass, etc.).
   - Recommend additional unit / integration / invariant tests.

2. **Repository Structure Analysis**

   - Evaluate folder layout (`src/`, `test/`, `script/`, `lib/`) for standard Foundry conventions.
   - Spot misplaced files, circular imports, or redundant libraries.

3. **Linting & Static Analysis**

   - Run `forge fmt`, `solhint`, and `slither` (or `foundry-config lint`) to surface:
     - unused state variables or imports
     - shadowed/local variables
     - naming, spacing, NatSpec doc issues
     - security findings (re-entrancy, tx-origin auth, unchecked calls).

4. **Abstractions & Complexity**

   - Review contract inheritance hierarchy, libraries, interfaces.
   - Identify over-abstracted or tightly-coupled modules.
   - Rate every contract’s cyclomatic complexity & gas profile; suggest optimisations (packed storage, custom errors, immutable, unchecked math).

5. **Refactoring Opportunities**

   - Propose concrete refactors: pull-apart large modifiers, extract libraries, consolidate duplicated logic, upgrade Safemath-style code to ≥0.8.
   - Highlight any breaking changes and migration steps.

6. **Code Patterns & Consistency**

   - Verify idiomatic patterns: _Checks-Effects-Interactions_, pull-over-push, events after state updates, EIP-173 Ownable, UUPS proxy, etc.
   - Check consistency of visibility (`external` vs `public`), NatSpec, error handling (custom errors vs `require`).
   - Flag anti-patterns (inline assembly without reason, magic numbers, hard-coded addresses).

7. **Recommendations**

   - Prioritised action list covering:
     1. **Critical security fixes**
     2. **Test coverage gaps**
     3. **Gas / storage optimisations**
     4. **Developer-experience improvements** (CI, linter, pre-commit hooks)

Present your analysis as a well-structured markdown document saved to **`docs/reviews/<BRANCH_NAME>.md`** with these sections:

# Project Analysis Report

Ensure every claim is backed by actual test runs or static-analysis output and delivers **actionable feedback**.
